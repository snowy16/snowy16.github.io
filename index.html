    <h1>Entry #1:</h1>
    <p style="text=align:right;">I dont like CSS. Now most of you would go, "It makes pages wonderful!"<br />And most of you would be like "So many colors and options!". I don't like <br />CSS because how bloated it can be. I belive that the beauty of a page<br />comes from the content, not all of the colors and animated pages<br />thar are made with Adobe Spark. I belive in this. I might add CSS,<br />but not a lot. I was actually gonna add a viewer counter but then,<br />the horrorizing fact of using divs and style and javascript just made me<br />decide its not worth it. And thanks for viewing my page 😺😺😺.<br>10:03 PST<br>9/28/22</p>
